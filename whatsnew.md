Duotang update {updatedate}:  

Detailed changes:
* Update to VirusSeq Release 2023-11-12 
* Changed reference lineage to EG.5.1.1 and EG.5\* plots. Selection plots now shows EG.5\*(reference), XBB.Other, HV.1 and BA.2 (non recombinant). (Resolves #292)
* Split XBB lineage into it's own group for individual lineage selection plots, BA.2 shows stricly nonrecombinant descendants. (Resolves #283)
* Fix the archive to show only published duotang versions rather than all. (Resolves #284)
* Properly sort the diversity tree nodes (this was a visual issue only.) (Resolves #286)
