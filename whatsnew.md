Duotang update {updatedate}:  

Detailed changes:
## duotang.html:
* The interactive trees now have a zoom slider. Omicron Diversity Tree tab had been removed because of this. (Closes #139)
* To reduce clutter and 'undefined' values, only the nodes on the tree now shows the information box when howered over with mouse.
* Optimized the json for the interactive trees to reduce the document size.
* Background changes to improve the updating and data ingest processes. As a result of this, dev previews had transitions into using cloudflare pages.
