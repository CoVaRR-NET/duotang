# SARS-CoV-2 In Canada

## Introduction

This notebook was built to explore Canadian SARS-CoV-2 genomic and epidemiological data with the aim of investigating viral evolution and spread. 
It is developed by the CAMEO team (Computational Analysis, Modelling and Evolutionary Outcomes Group) associated with the Coronavirus Variants Rapid Response Network (CoVaRR-Net) for sharing with collaborators, including public health labs. 
These analyses are freely available and open source, enabling code reuse by public health authorities and other researchers for their own use.

Canadian genomic and epidemiological data will be regularly pulled from various public sources (see list below) to keep these analyses up-to-date.
Only representations of aggregate data will be posted here.

## Important limitations
These analyses represent only a snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in Canada. Only some infections are detected by PCR testing, only some of those are sent for whole-genome sequencing, and not all sequences are posted to public facing reposittories.
Furthermore, sequencing volumes and priorities have changed during the pandemic, specific variants or populations might be preferentially sequenced at certain times in certain jurisdictions.
When possible, these differences in sampling strategies are mentioned but they are not always known.
With the arrival of the Omicron wave, many jurisdictions across Canada reached testing and sequencing capacity mid-late December 2021 and thus switched to targeted testing of priority groups (e.g., hospitalized patients, health care workers, and people in high-risk settings).
Currently, most jurisdictions are sequencing mainly hospitalized patients or outbreaks, with little population-level random sampling, underestimating case counts and viral diversity.

Thus, interpretation of these plots and comparisons between health regions should be made with caution, considering that the data may not be fully representative.
These analyses are subject to frequent change given new data and updated lineage designations.

We thank the global team of those monitoring variants (such as those posting issues here: https://github.com/cov-lineages/pango-designation/issues), and other SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis tool providers (see [List of Useful Tools below](#Appendix)), which play a key role in identifying new variants of note.

# Sublineages in Canada 

There are `r length(uniqueNamedLineageLast120Days)` unique named variants currently circulating in Canada since `r startdate` (last 120 days). Please see [Pango lineage table](#lineages) for number of sequences per lineage present.

Below is an interactive visualization showing frequencies of ciruclating lineages, sub-divided by major sub-lineages, currently circulating in Canada. A table of lineage frequencies can be downloaded by clicking on the (Frequency Table Download) button.

## Future development

We are in the process of adding or would like to develop code for some of the following analyses:   

* dN/dS (by variant and by gene/domains)  
* Tajima's D over time  
* clustering analyses
* genomically inferred epidemiological parameters: R0, serial interval, etc.

With anonymized data on vaccination status, severity/outcome, reason for sequencing (*e.g.*, outbreak, hospitalization, or general sampling), and setting (workplace, school, daycare, LTC, health institution, other), we could analyze genomic characteristics of the virus relative to the epidemiological and immunological conditions in which it is spreading and evolving.
Studies on mutational correlations to superspreading events, vaccination status, or comparisons between variants would allow us to better understand transmission and evolution in these environments.

## Methodology {.tabset .tabset-fade} 

Genome data and metadata are sourced from the [Canadian VirusSeq Data Portal](https://virusseq-dataportal.ca/).
Pango lineage assignments are generated using the [pangoLEARN](https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangoLEARN) algorithm.
Source code for generating this RMarkdown notebook can be found in [https://github.com/CoVaRR-NET/duotang].

### Trees
#### Phylogenetic trees
Canadian genomes were obtained from the VirusSeq data on the `r VirusSeq_release` and down-sampled to two genomes per lineage, province and month before October 2021, and five genomes per lineage, province and month after October 2021 (about 10,000 genomes in total).
We used a Python wrapper of [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) (version 2.17) to generate multiple sequence alignments for these genome samples.
A maximum likelihood (ML) tree was reconstructed from each alignment using the COVID-19 release of [IQ-TREE](http://www.iqtree.org/) (version 2.2.0).
Outliers were identified in by root-to-tip regression using the R package [ape](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/) and removed from the dataset.
[TreeTime](https://github.com/neherlab/treetime) was used to reconstruct a time-scaled tree under a strict molecular clock model.
The resulting trees were converted into interactive plots with [ggfree](https://github.com/ArtPoon/ggfree) and [r2d3](https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/).

### Selection
#### Selection Coefficents
To estimate selection, we used standard likelihood techniques.
In brief, sublineages of interest were prespecified (e.g., JN.1) and counts by day tracked over time.
If selection were constant over time, the frequency of sub-type $i$ at time $t$ would be expected to rise according to $$p_i(t) = \frac{p_i(0) \exp(s_i t)}{\sum_j p_j(0) \exp(s_j t)},$$ where $s_i$ is the selection coefficient favouring sub-type $i$.
A selection coefficient of $s_i=0.1$ implies that sub-type $i$ is expected to rise from 10% to 90% frequency in 44 days (in $4.4./s_i$ days for other values of $s_i$).

At any given time $t$, the probability of observing $n_i$ sequences of sublineage $i$ is multinomially distributed, given the total number of sequences from that day and the frequency of each $p_i(t)$.
Consequently, the likelihood of seeing the observed sequence data over all times $t$ and over all sublineages $j$ is proportional to $$L = \prod_t \prod_j  p_i(t)^{n_i(t)}.$$

The [BBMLE](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bbmle/bbmle.pdf) package in R was used to maximize the likelihood of the observed data (using the default optimization method, optim).
For each selection coefficient, 95% confidence intervals were obtained by profile likelihood (using uniroot). 

Graphs illustrating the rise in frequency of a variant over time are shown (left panels), with the area of each dot proportional to the number of sequences.
95% confidence bands were obtained by randomly drawing 10,000 sets of parameters ($p_i$ and $s_i$ for each sub-type) using `RandomFromHessianOrMCMC`, assuming a multi-normal distribution around the maximum likelihood point (estimated from the Hessian matrix, [Pawitan 2001](https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=WHsSDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=Pawitan+2001+likelihood&ots=v9sM5DuFrf&sig=vnRb--i2zu0jox_KnBSVxtG2aPg#v=onepage&q=Pawitan%202001%20likelihood&f=false)).
At each point in time, the 2.5%-97.5% range of values for $p_i(t)$ are then shown in the confidence bands.

Logit plots (right panels) show $$ln(\frac{p_i(t)}{p_{ref}(t)})$$ relative to a given reference genotype (here BA.1), which gives a line whose slope is the strength of selection $s_i$.
Changes in slope indicate changes in selection on a variant (*e.g.*, see [Otto et al.](https://mast.queensu.ca/~tday/pdf/Otto2021.pdf)).

These estimates of selection ignore heterogeneity within provinces and may be biased by the arrival of travel-related cases while frequencies are very low.
Sampling strategies that oversample clustered cases (*e.g.*, sequencing outbreaks) will introduce additional variation beyond the multinomial expectation, but these should lead to one-time shifts in frequency rather than trends over time.
Provinces with sampling strategies that are variant specific are removed, unless explicit information about the variant frequencies is available.

#### Detection trends by variant 

As of 13 July 2024, the number of detected cases for all provinces are obtained from the âRespiratory virus detection dataâ (PHAC; [link](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/respiratory-virus-detections/)), multiplying the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests times the fraction that are positive. These reported counts are then normalized to cases per 100,000 individual based off of Statistics Canada's population estimates for each province or the total population of Canada. We then remove the last 1 data point as those data continue to be gathered and are likely underestimated. This normalized cases over time ($n$) is then log transformed and fitted to a smooth spline with a lambda value of 0.001 using the R stats' smooth.spline() function. A list of smoothed detection counts ($n(t)$), where each element correspond to a count on a particular date $t$, is then obtained from this fitting function by reversing the log transformation.

The previously discussed methods allow us to estimate the proportion of a lineage over time (see equation for $p_i(t)$ above). This produces a list of proportions for each lineage of interest, where each element correspond to a lineage proportion on a particular date, $t$. By multiplying the list from detection counts to this lineage frequency list at all time points, we can estimate the inferred number of reported cases that are due to a specific lineage at each time point as $$n_i(t) = p_i(t) \; n(t).$$

Finally, once the inferred detection counts ($n_i(t)$) of each lineages are calculated, we take the last two days of data from the smooth spline times lineage frequency curve to get $n_i(t)$ and $n_i(t-1)$, from which the growth rate of that lineage ($r_i$) is estimated as $$r_i = ln\left( \frac{n_i(t)}{n_i(t-1)} \right).$$

Because genomics data often lag detection count data, the last date of reliable detection count data may be closer to the present than the last date of genomics data. In these cases, the evolutionary model for $p_i(t)$ is projected forward in time and shown as a ligher shaded area under the curve within the plot).

#### Rates
##### Root-to-tip estimates of substitution rate
Substitution rates were obtained from the maximum likelihood tree made using [IQ-TREE](http://www.iqtree.org/) and a [root-to-tip regression](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/ape/html/rtt.html) conducted, without forcing the intercept to zero (similar results were seen when forcing the intercept). Up to 10000 samples for non-XBB lineages and all samples for XBB lineages are used to construct this tree. For the estimation of each VOI's substitution rates over time, all sequences of that VOI present in the tree are used. While this ignores pseudo-replication among the samples due to relatedness, the estimated slope is robust given the large sample sizes. Furthermore, we calculated SE bars from three different independent samples to reduce the influence of closely related viral samples. The global rate estimate was obtained by a regression over time of all the sequences present in the tree, as illustrated in the root-to-tip plot, ignoring variants classification.


## Data notes by province {.tabset .tabset-fade}

All analyses draw on the most recent publicly available viral sequence data on ViralSeq and should be interpreted with caution due to lags in reporting and sequencing priorities that can differ across provinces or territories. Note that the NCCID provides a timeline of Canadian events related to each variant: https://nccid.ca/covid-19-variants/. 

As of 13 July 2024, the number of detected cases is obtained from the âRespiratory virus detection dataâ (PHAC; [link](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/respiratory-virus-detections/)).


## Historical notes

From the beginning of the pandemic to the fall of 2021, Canadian sequences were mostly of the wildtype lineages (pre-VOCs).
By the beginning of summer 2021, the VOCs Alpha and Gamma were the most sequenced lineages overall in Canada.
The Delta wave grew during the summer of 2021 with sublineages AY.25 and AY.27 constituting sizeable proportions of this wave. Omicron arrived in November of 2021 and spread in three main waves, first BA.1* (early 2022), then BA.2* (spring 2022), then BA.5* (summer 2022). Current, multiple sublineages of Omicron persist, with emerging sublineages spreading, such as BQ.1.1 (a BA.5 sub-lineage).

There are two Pango lineages that have a Canadian origin and that predominately spread within Canada (with some exportations internationally): B.1.438.1 and B.1.1.176. Other lineages of historical interest in Canada:  

* A.2.5.2 - an A lineage (clade 19B) that spread in Quebec, involved in several outbreaks before Delta arrived  (see this post for more details: https://virological.org/t/recent-evolution-and-international-transmission-of-sars-cov-2-clade-19b-pango-a-lineages/711)
* B.1.2 - a USA lineage that spread well in Canada  
* B.1.160 - an European lineages that spread well in Canada  

This historical analysis is not being further updated, as we focus on more interactive data plots and the âCurrent situationâ text above.
