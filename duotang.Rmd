# Introduction  

This notebook is built to explore Canadian SARS-CoV-2 genomic and epidemiological data with the aim of investigating viral evolution and spread.
It is for discussion with pillar 6's team and for sharing with collaborators, e.g. public health labs.
These analyses can spur further research within or across pillars, be used for reports (or data dashboards), support discussions with the science communication pillar for public dissemination, and enable code reuse by public health authorities/laboratories for their internal use.

Canadian genomic and epidemiological data will be regularly pulled from various public sources (see list below) to keep these analyses up-to-date.
Only representations of aggregate data will be posted here.

**Important caveats and disclaimers:**  
These analyses represent only a snapshot of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in Canada. Only some infections are detected by PCR testing, only some of those are sent for whole-genome sequencing, and not all sequences are posted to public facing reposittories.
Sequencing volumes and priorities have changed during the pandemic, and the sequencing strategy is typically a combination of prioritizing outbreaks, travellers, public health investigations, and random sampling for genomic surveillance.

For example, specific variants or populations might be preferentially sequenced at certain times in certain jurisdictions.
When possible, these differences in sampling strategies are mentioned but they are not always known.
With the arrival of the Omicron wave, many jurisdictions across Canada reached testing and sequencing capacity mid-late December 2021 and thus switched to targeted testing of priority groups (e.g., hospitalized patients, health care workers, and people in high-risk settings).
Therefore, from this time onward, case counts are likely underestimated and the sequenced virus diversity is not necessarily representative of the virus circulating in the overall population. 

Thus, interpretation of these plots and comparisons between health regions should be made with caution, considering that the data may not be fully representative.
These analyses are subject to frequent change given new data and updated lineage designations.

The last sample collection date is `r format(as.Date(max(meta$sample_collection_date)), '%d %B, %Y' )`

# SARS-CoV-2 in Canada

## Current situation

**[NOTE: Barplots for lineage frequencies are now interactive, and new tables were added. All tables are now searchable, and the data downloadable.]**

XBB.1.5, combined with its subvariants and other variants with the mutation S:F486P, are still collectively growing in all regions of Canada. This collective set includes XBB.1.9.1, and XBF subvariants. Some BQ.1 subvariants are increasing in some regions of Canada along with CH.1.1. Differences between some provinces continue - see the evolving plots below of “Fastest growing lineages in Canada”, and “case count trends by variant”, per province.

**Variants of current interest**, due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries (note that some of these are not yet detected in Canada):

* BM.1.1.1
* BM.2 (high predicted affinity for the human ACE2 receptor)
* BN.1* subvariants due to high predicted immune evasion
* BQ.1.8 with S:F486P and S:L452R (seen recently in Ontario)
* BQ.1* select new descendants, particularly BQ.1.1.5 with S:Y453F
* BW.1, BW.1.1, BW.1.1.2 (descendants of BA.5.6, with S:F486A)
* CH.1.1 (descendant of BM which is BA.2.75.3 with S:L452R) and sublineages
* DN.1/DN.1.1 (BQ.1.1.5 descendants with S:K147N) - that also has S:Y453F (and so is actually DN.1.1.1 but this isn’t in databases yet)
* DN.1.1.1 (highest predicted affinity for the human ACE2 receptor)
* DS.1 (highest predicted immune evasion)
* EF.1 (BQ.1.1.13 subvariant)
* EG.1 (a XBB.1.9.1 subvariant)
* EK variants (subvariants ofXBB.1.5.13)
* XBB.1, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.5.13, XBB.1.9.1, XBB.1.10, XBB.1.12, XBB.6.1 and subvariants with S:F486P (or other mutations of note like S:Y453F)
* XBF subvariants (BA.5.2/CJ.1 recombinant; have S:F486P and immune evasion like XBB.1.5)
* XBK and XBL (have S:F486P and immune evasion like XBB.1.5)
* …and other variants with mutations associated with immune evasion or higher binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor (examples: S:K147N, S:R346T, S:R403K, S:L452R, S:Y453F, S:F486P, S:490P, S:Q613H), particularly those variants with sets of immune evasive mutations of interest.

##### Historical notes

From the beginning of the pandemic to the fall of 2021, Canadian sequences were mostly of the wildtype lineages (pre-VOCs).
By the beginning of summer 2021, the VOCs Alpha and Gamma were the most sequenced lineages overall in Canada.
The Delta wave grew during the summer of 2021 with sublineages AY.25 and AY.27 constituting sizeable proportions of this wave. Omicron arrived in November of 2021 and spread in three main waves, first BA.1* (early 2022), then BA.2* (spring 2022), then BA.5* (summer 2022). Current, multiple sublineages of Omicron persist, with emerging sublineages spreading, such as BQ.1.1 (a BA.5 sub-lineage).

There are two Pango lineages that have a Canadian origin and that predominately spread within Canada (with some exportations internationally): B.1.438.1 and B.1.1.176. Other lineages of historical interest in Canada:  

* A.2.5.2 - an A lineage (clade 19B) that spread in Quebec, involved in several outbreaks before Delta arrived  (see this post for more details: https://virological.org/t/recent-evolution-and-international-transmission-of-sars-cov-2-clade-19b-pango-a-lineages/711)
* B.1.2 - a USA lineage that spread well in Canada  
* B.1.160 - an European lineages that spread well in Canada  

This historical analysis is not being further updated, as we focus on more interactive data plots and the “Current situation” text above.

## Future development

We are in the process of adding or would like to develop code for some of the following analyses:   

* dN/dS (by variant and by gene/domains)  
* Tajima's D over time  
* clustering analyses
* genomically inferred epidemiological parameters: R0, serial interval, etc.

With anonymized data on vaccination status, severity/outcome, reason for sequencing (*e.g.*, outbreak, hospitalization, or general sampling), and setting (workplace, school, daycare, LTC, health institution, other), we could analyze genomic characteristics of the virus relative to the epidemiological and immunological conditions in which it is spreading and evolving.
Studies on mutational correlations to superspreading events, vaccination status, or comparisons between variants would allow us to better understand transmission and evolution in these environments.   


## Methodology {.tabset} 

Genome data and metadata are sourced from the [Canadian VirusSeq Data Portal](https://virusseq-dataportal.ca/).
Pango lineage assignments are generated using the [pangoLEARN](https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangoLEARN) algorithm.
Source code for generating this RMarkdown notebook can be found in [https://github.com/CoVaRR-NET/duotang].

### Trees
#### Phylogenetic trees
Canadian genomes were obtained from the VirusSeq data on the `r VirusSeq_release` and down-sampled to two genomes per lineage, province and month before October 2021, and five genomes per lineage, province and month after October 2021 (about 10,000 genomes in total).
We used a Python wrapper of [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) (version 2.17) to generate multiple sequence alignments for these genome samples.
A maximum likelihood (ML) tree was reconstructed from each alignment using the COVID-19 release of [IQ-TREE](http://www.iqtree.org/) (version 2.2.0).
Outliers were identified in by root-to-tip regression using the R package [ape](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/) and removed from the dataset.
[TreeTime](https://github.com/neherlab/treetime) was used to reconstruct a time-scaled tree under a strict molecular clock model.
The resulting trees were converted into interactive plots with [ggfree](https://github.com/ArtPoon/ggfree) and [r2d3](https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/).

### Mutational composition
#### Mutation composition graph
We extracted mutation frequencies from unaligned genomes using a custom Python wrapper of [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) (version 2.17).
These data were supplemented with genomic data and metadata from the [NCBI GenNank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) database, curated by the [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/open/global) development team.
We used these outputs to generate mutational graphs reporting mutations seen in at least 75% of sequences in the respective variants of concern in Canada.
Bars are colored by substitution type, and the corresponding amino acid changes are shown.
Genomic position annotations were generated in Python using [SnpEFF](http://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/).

### Selection
#### Selection Coefficents
To estimate selection, we used standard likelihood techniques.
In brief, sublineages of interest were prespecified (e.g., BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2) and counts by day tracked over time.
If selection were constant over time, the frequency of sub-type $i$ at time $t$ would be expected to rise according to $$p_i(t) = \frac{p_i(0) \exp(s_i t)}{\sum_j p_j(0) \exp(s_j t)},$$ where $s_i$ is the selection coefficient favouring sub-type $i$.
A selection coefficient of $s_i=0.1$ implies that sub-type $i$ is expected to rise from 10% to 90% frequency in 44 days (in $4.4./s_i$ days for other values of $s_i$).

At any given time $t$, the probability of observing $n_i$ sequences of sublineage $i$ is multinomially distributed, given the total number of sequences from that day and the frequency of each $p_i(t)$.
Consequently, the likelihood of seeing the observed sequence data over all times $t$ and over all sublineages $j$ is proportional to $$L = \prod_t \prod_j  p_i(t)^{n_i(t)}.$$

The [BBMLE](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bbmle/bbmle.pdf) package in R was used to maximize the likelihood of the observed data (using the default optimization method, optim).
For each selection coefficient, 95% confidence intervals were obtained by profile likelihood (using uniroot). 

Graphs illustrating the rise in frequency of a variant over time are shown (left panels), with the area of each dot proportional to the number of sequences.
95% confidence bands were obtained by randomly drawing 10,000 sets of parameters ($p_i$ and $s_i$ for each sub-type) using `RandomFromHessianOrMCMC`, assuming a multi-normal distribution around the maximum likelihood point (estimated from the Hessian matrix, [Pawitan 2001](https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=WHsSDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=Pawitan+2001+likelihood&ots=v9sM5DuFrf&sig=vnRb--i2zu0jox_KnBSVxtG2aPg#v=onepage&q=Pawitan%202001%20likelihood&f=false)).
At each point in time, the 2.5%-97.5% range of values for $p_i(t)$ are then shown in the confidence bands.

Logit plots (right panels) show $$ln(\frac{p_i(t)}{p_{ref}(t)})$$ relative to a given reference genotype (here BA.1), which gives a line whose slope is the strength of selection $s_i$.
Changes in slope indicate changes in selection on a variant (*e.g.*, see [Otto et al.](https://mast.queensu.ca/~tday/pdf/Otto2021.pdf)).

These estimates of selection ignore heterogeneity within provinces and may be biased by the arrival of travel-related cases while frequencies are very low.
Sampling strategies that oversample clustered cases (*e.g.*, sequencing outbreaks) will introduce additional variation beyond the multinomial expectation, but these should lead to one-time shifts in frequency rather than trends over time.
Provinces with sampling strategies that are variant specific are removed, unless explicit information about the variant frequencies is available.

## Data notes by province {.tabset}

All analyses draw on the most recent publicly available viral sequence data on ViralSeq and should be interpreted with caution due to lags in reporting and sequencing priorities that can differ across provinces or territories. Note that the NCCID provides a timeline of Canadian events related to each variant: https://nccid.ca/covid-19-variants/.
