# CoVaRRNet_Pillar6_Notebook

R notebook for compiling our analyses

To view, see here:
https://github.com/CoVaRR-NET/CoVaRRNet_Pillar6_Notebook/blob/main/Rnotebook_demo_covarrnetpillar6.html

Can be executable code to make the plots inside code snippets or simply paste your latest plots (but add the file to the "data_needed" directory so we can generate it).

contributors: Carmen Lia Murall, Raphael Poujol, Susanne Kraemer, Arnaud N'Guessan, Art Poon, Jesse Shapiro, and more. See html for full list, including Canadian labs that generate the data and make it publicly available.

Thanks to Gavin Douglas for the template and Git tech! @gavinmdouglas
