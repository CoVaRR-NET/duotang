Cases are low. Some variants are showing notable growth, including those listed below, and are being tracked. There is no evidence to date though of a significant new wave occurring in the near future.



Note that there has been a reduction in data, potentially causing delays in the detection of new variants and more uncertainty when estimating selection.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



* <u id='NB_1_8_1'>NB.1.8.1</u> (an <u id='XDV'>XDV</u> subvariant) which has been showing significant growth globally and in Canada (and subvariants PQ.**).
* <u id='XFG'>XFG</u>, a recombinant of <u id='LF_7'>LF.7</u> and <u id='LP_8_1_2'>LP.8.1.2</u>, showing significant growth globally, and detected in Canada, including select subvariants. 

Plus any other highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see some references under List of Useful Tools below).



We thank the global team of those monitoring variants (such as those posting issues here: <https://github.com/cov-lineages/pango-designation/issues|https://github.com/cov-lineages/pango-designation/issues>), and other SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis tool providers (see List of Useful Tools below), which play a key role in identifying new variants of note.
