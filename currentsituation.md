<u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> is clearly dominating now in most provinces, after a delay versus some other countries. Some provinces, particularly in the maritimes, have some further delayed introduction of <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u>. There is still continued growth though of other variants like <u id='KP_2_3'>KP.2.3</u>, <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u> and <u id='LB_1'>LB.1</u> variants/subvariants. Variants of note frequently contain the S:S31del mutation (e.g. <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> and <u id='KP_2_3'>KP.2.3</u>). Some recombinants of interest globally are either not yet detected in Canada, or are at low levels (ie. <u id='XEC'>XEC</u>).



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



* Variants with S:S31del (also referred to as S:S31-) including <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> in particular and its subvariants (<u id='MC_1'>MC.1</u>). plus <u id='KP_2_3'>KP.2.3</u>, <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u>, and <u id='LB_1'>LB.1</u> subvariants.
* Some recombinants such as <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> (recombinant of <u id='KS_1_1'>KS.1.1</u> and <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u>).

Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see references under List of Useful Tools below).
