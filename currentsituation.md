Current Situation:

(note a correction in referencing <u id='LB_1'>LB.1</u> plus S:S31del from the last update).



<u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> (<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> with S:F456L and S:Q493E) is still the most dominant variant in Canada overall. <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> has grown most significantly in those regions with less <u id='KP_2'>KP.2</u> (<u id='JN_1_11'>JN.1.11</u> with S:F456L and S:R346T, aka the “FLiRT” mutations), while <u id='KP_2'>KP.2</u> is still quite prevalent in those regions where it appeared first. <u id='LB_1'>LB.1</u> (<u id='JN_1_9'>JN.1.9</u> plus the FLiRT mutations) and <u id='KP_2_3'>KP.2.3</u> (<u id='KP_2'>KP.2</u> plus S:H146Q) - each with S:S31del - are growing significantly in multiple regions globally, and where there wasn’t early introduction and spread of variants like <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u>.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



* <u id='JN_1_7'>JN.1.7</u> subvariants and other variants growing that have S:T572I (potentially increases ACE2 binding) with a particular interest with those with also S:R346T like <u id='KQ_1'>KQ.1</u> and <u id='XDK_1'>XDK.1</u> (nicknamed as having “TIRT” mutations).
* <u id='KP_2'>KP.2</u> (<u id='JN_1_11'>JN.1.11</u> with S:F456L and S:R346T and other variants with these “FLiRT” mutations including also <u id='KP_1_1'>KP.1.1</u> and <u id='KS_1'>KS.1</u>). With a particular interest in those that also have an S:S31del deletion (in particular <u id='KP_2_3'>KP.2.3</u>) or other changes at position 31 in the Spike protein.
* <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> (with S:F456L and S:Q493) which is now the most prevalent variant in Canada overall. Also of particular interest are its subvariants.
* <u id='KZ_1_1_1'>KZ.1.1.1</u> (and others with S:F456L, S:R356T and S:T572I - nicknamed a “FLiRTTI” variant.
* <u id='LB_1'>LB.1</u> (<u id='JN_1_9'>JN.1.9</u> with FLiRT mutations), with S:S31del, and other variants with S:S31del and other mutations at this position 31.

Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning that are involved in binding or immune evasion. See:
