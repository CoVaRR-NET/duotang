<u id='A'>A</u> real mix of <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> subvariants with different combinations of immune evasive mutations are currently growing in proportion, in particular those that have (1) the “FLIRT” mutations S:F456L and S:R356T like <u id='KP_2'>KP.2</u>  (can be falsely classified as <u id='JN_1_11_1'>JN.1.11.1</u>) or <u id='KS_1'>KS.1</u> (can be falsely classified as <u id='JN_1_13_1'>JN.1.13.1</u>), plus (2) those with S:T572I (like <u id='JN_1_7'>JN.1.7</u> and <u id='JN_1_32'>JN.1.32</u>, or <u id='KQ_1'>KQ.1</u> which is a <u id='JN_1_4'>JN.1.4</u> descendant that has both S:346T and S:572I) or (3) those with S:Q493E (like <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> with S:456L and S:493E - it can also be falsely classified as <u id='JN_1_11_1'>JN.1.11.1</u>). Multiple variants not yet in Canada have a triple combination of S:F456L, S:R356T and S:T572I (nicknamed “FLiRTTI” variants, like <u id='KZ_1_1_1'>KZ.1.1.1</u>, with again some of these variants falsely classified as their ancestor lineage).



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):

* <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> (<u id='BA_2_86_1'>BA.2.86.1</u> with immune evasive mutation S:455S). Still the most common variant in Canada though dropping in proportion significantly).
* <u id='JN_1_7'>JN.1.7</u> and other variants growing that have S:T572I (potentially increases ACE2 binding) with a particular interest with those with also S:R346T like <u id='KQ_1'>KQ.1</u> and <u id='XDK_1'>XDK.1</u> (nicknamed as having “TIRT” mutations).
* <u id='KP_2'>KP.2</u> (<u id='JN_1_11'>JN.1.11</u> with S:F456L and S:R346T and other variants with these “FLiRT” mutations including <u id='KP_1_1'>KP.1.1</u> and <u id='KS_1'>KS.1</u>).
* <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> (with S:F456L and S:Q493)
* <u id='KZ_1_1_1'>KZ.1.1.1</u> (and others with S:F456L, S:R356T and S:T572I - nicknamed a “FLiRTTI” variant.

Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning that are involved in binding or immune evasion. See:
