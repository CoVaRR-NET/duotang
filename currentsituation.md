<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> still predominates, but multiple variants with the immune evasive mutations S:F456L and S:R346T (nicknamed the "FLiRT" combination of mutations) are growing notably, along with some variants like <u id='JN_1_7'>JN.1.7</u> with S:T572I (a mutation that may increase ACE2 binding). Currently <u id='KP_2'>KP.2</u> (<u id='JN_1_11_1'>JN.1.11.1</u> with S:R346T) is showing the most growth overall (albiet still at low numbers). Note that many <u id='KP_2'>KP.2</u> and the similar variant <u id='KP_1_1'>KP.1.1</u> may be currently falsely classified as their ancestor <u id='JN_1_11_1'>JN.1.11.1</u>. Saltations (variants with a sudden large increase in number of mutations) are still being closely tracked.



Variants of current interest:



(Due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries.)



* <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> (<u id='BA_2_86_1'>BA.2.86.1</u> with immune evasive mutation S:455S). Still the most common variant in Canada).
* <u id='JN_1_7'>JN.1.7</u> and other variants growing that have S:T572I (potentially increases ACE2 binding) with a particular interest with those with also S:R346T like <u id='KQ_1'>KQ.1</u> and <u id='XDK_1'>XDK.1</u> (nicknamed as having "TIRT" mutations).
* <u id='KP_2'>KP.2</u> (<u id='JN_1_11'>JN.1.11</u> with S:F456L and S:R346T and other variants with these "FLiRT" mutations including <u id='KP_1_1'>KP.1.1</u>).

Plus any highly divergent variants (saltations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning that are involved in binding or immune evasion. See:
