<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> and its subvariants continue to predominate, with <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> still being most prevalent overall, followed by <u id='JN_1_4'>JN.1.4</u>. Sets of <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> subvariants with additional proposed ACE2 receptor binding enhancing mutations are being tracked, with the mutation S:T572I being acquired multiple times independently and showing notable growth overall. Immune evasive mutations (such as S:R346T) are also being tracked, along with those with combinations of mutations that potentially change both receptor binding and immune evasion. However, currently there is no major evidence that a single <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> subvariant is significantly outcompeting <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u>. Saltations (variants with a sudden large increase in number of mutations) are still being closely tracked.



Variants of current interest:

(Due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries.)



* <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> (<u id='BA_2_86_1'>BA.2.86.1</u> with immune evasive mutation S:455S - still the most common variant in Canada).
* <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> with S:Y453F (this mutation potentially increases ACE2 receptor binding, but no widespread growth seen yet)
* <u id='JN_1_4'>JN.1.4</u> (<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> with ORF1a:T170I. <u id='JN_1_4'>JN.1.4</u> is currently the most common subvariant of <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u>. There's a particular interest in those with S:T572I, which potentially increases ACE2 binding and is showing notable growth, plus those with both S:T572I and the immune evasive mutation S:R346T together.)
* <u id='JN_1_7'>JN.1.7</u> (<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> with S:T572I and S:E1150D, or others with S:T572I like <u id='JN_1_8_1'>JN.1.8.1</u>)
* <u id='JN_1_6_1'>JN.1.6.1</u> (<u id='JN_1_6'>JN.1.6</u> with S:R346T, and other variants with immune evasive mutations like S:R346T).
