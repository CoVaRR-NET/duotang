<u id='LP_8_1_1'>LP.8.1.1</u> and <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> are still prevalent in most regions. Some variants are showing notable growth and are being tracked, but currently there is no evidence of a notable new wave occurring.



Note that there has been a reduction in data, potentially causing delays in the detection of new variants and more uncertainty when estimating selection.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



* <u id='LP_8_1_1'>LP.8.1.1</u> - <u id='LP_8_1'>LP.8.1</u> is a <u id='KP_1_1'>KP.1.1</u> “FLIRT” subvariant with the mutation S:493E and then S:190S, which is a predicted immune escape mutation. <u id='LP_8_1'>LP.8.1</u> has been shown experimentally to have higher binding affinity for the ACE2 human host receptor but equivalent immune escape as <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> (<https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.27.630350v1> plus see updated paper <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00015-5/fulltext> ). However the subvariant <u id='LP_8_1_1'>LP.8.1.1</u> also has the mutation S:679R which potentially further impacts transmissibility. (See also this recent study regarding ACE2 affinity: <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2825%2900113-6/fulltext>)
* <u id='LF_7'>LF.7</u> subvariants (derived from <u id='JN_1_16'>JN.1.16</u>), including <u id='LF_7_7_2'>LF.7.7.2</u>.
* <u id='NB_1_8_1'>NB.1.8.1</u> (an <u id='XDV'>XDV</u> subvariant) which has been predominant in Hong Kong but also showing significant growth in other countries and now recently detected in Canada.

Plus any other highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see some references under List of Useful Tools below).
