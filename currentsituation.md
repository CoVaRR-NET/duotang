Variants with the S:S31del mutation are still growing rapidly, involving multiple variant backgrounds including <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> subvariants (with S:F456L and S:Q493E) and multiple different variants with S:F456L and S:R346T (aka the “FLiRT” mutations). Different variants with this deletion are growing in different regions, depending on timing of introduction.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



* Variants with S:S31del (also referred to as S:S31-) including subvariants of <u id='KP_1'>KP.1</u>, <u id='KP_2_3'>KP.2.3</u>, <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> (in particular <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u>), and <u id='LB_1'>LB.1</u>, plus additional <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> variants like <u id='KP_3_2_3'>KP.3.2.3</u>.

Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see references under List of Useful Tools below).
