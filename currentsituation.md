<u id='XEC'>XEC</u> (a recombinant with the KP.3-type spike) becoming more prominent now. Any growth to date of all variants is still relatively small, verses what has been seen for past notable waves.

Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):

* <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> which also has a KP.3-type spike, (recombinant of <u id='KS_1_1'>KS.1.1</u> and <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u>) but some changes that appear to confer a slight advantage including immune evasion.
* <u id='LP_8_1'>LP.8.1</u> (derived from <u id='KP_1_1_3'>KP.1.1.3</u>) - but note it is not showing significant growth in all regions.
* Additional subvariants of <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u>/<u id='MC_1'>MC.1</u> showing some more recent growth.
* Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see some references under List of Useful Tools below).
