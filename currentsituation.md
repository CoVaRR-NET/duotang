For variants that are growing in multiple provinces, EG.5.1.1 is now the fastest growing variant in Canada. It’s also estimated to now be the most prevalent variant in many regions. However, there are still other variants growing that are of note, including FL.1.5.1, which has similar growth globally, and some other subvariants of XBB.1.16, XBB.2.3, and XBB.1.5 with immune evasive mutations.



Variants with the two mutations S:456L and S:455F (of interest due to their potential to provide additional immune evasion) are growing in some regions, though still in low numbers.



Sequences are also still being monitored closely to identify or track any saltation variants (variants with sudden, large mutational changes) that might arise.



Variants of current interest, due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries (**bold** denotes changes since the last Duotang release):



* EG.5.1 (XBB.1.9.2 with S:F456L plus S:Q52H plus some notable non-spike mutations)
* **EG.5.1.1 (EG.5.1 subvariant that has been growing most significantly versus all other current variants, including other EG.5 subvariants).**
* Multiple **XBB.1.5, GK and HK subvariants and others that have S:F456L and S:L455F**
* FL.1.5.1 (XBB.1.9.1 with S:701V, ORF1a:G993S, S:456L and S:478R).
* XBB.1.16 which has S:T478R (with a particular interest in those with S:F456L like XBB.1.16.6)
* XBB.1.9.1, XBB.1.9.2, FL.5 (which have non-spike mutations of note, with a particular interest in those with S:Q613H OR with S:F456L plus NS6:Y49H (aka orf6:y49h)
* XBB.2.3, XBB.2.3.2, XBB.2.3.3 (has mutation S:P521S, with an interest in those also with mutation 478R)
* XBC.1.6 subvariants (XBC.1 is a “Deltacron” recombinant lineage of BA.2 and B.1.617.2 with S:L452M. XBC.1.6 contains also S:346S, S:M452R).

…plus any saltation variants and sublineages with additional combinations of the mutations below.



* S:Q:52H (due to association with EG.5.1)
* **S:L455F (in particular if present with S:F456L)**
* S:F456L (evidence of increased immune evasion versus recent variants and a mutation growing in prevalence in multiple lineages in multiple regions)
* S:T478R (aka S:K478R - the S:T478K mutation occurred first). Evidence of increased infectivity when introduced into XBB.1.5. Associated with XBB.1.16 (which has additional mutations like S:E180V that may counteract this mutations advantage) but now seen in additional variants like XBB.2.3.
* S:P521S (evidence it could increase human ACE2 receptor binding/infectivity - associated with XBB.2.3 variants)
* S:Q613H (growing and seen in XBB.1.5, CH.1.1 and XBB.1.9.1)
* ORF1b:D1746Y (aka NSP14_D222Y - in XBB.1.16 variants)
* ORF9b:I5T (note its a synonymous mutation in the overlapping N gene)
* ORF9b:N55S (synonymous mutation in N)
