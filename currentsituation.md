<u id='XEC'>XEC</u> continues to be widely prevalent. <u id='LP_8_1_1'>LP.8.1.1</u> is still showing selective growth in multiple regions. Variants of other potential interest include <u id='LF_7_2'>LF.7.2</u>/<u id='LF_7_2_1'>LF.7.2.1</u> subvariants (<u id='JN_1_16'>JN.1.16</u> subvariants) which are showing selective growth in multiple regions of Canada and internationally. Note there was also detection of two saltations (lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations), both internationally (named <u id='BA_3_2'>BA.3.2</u>) and another <u id='BQ_1_1_1'>BQ.1.1.1</u> first detected in Canada. However, to date there is no evidence that these particular saltations can compete well against other widely circulating variants. The SMDP app (<https://eringill.shinyapps.io/covid_mutation_distributions/>) suggests these two saltations are most likely derived from chronic infections.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



* <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> which has a KP.3-type spike, (recombinant of <u id='KS_1_1'>KS.1.1</u> and <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u>) but some changes that appear to confer a slight advantage including immune evasion, and some variants like
* <u id='LP_8_1_1'>LP.8.1.1</u> - <u id='LP_8_1'>LP.8.1</u> is a <u id='KP_1_1'>KP.1.1</u> “FLIRT” subvariant with the mutation S:493E and then S:190S, which is a predicted immune escape mutation. <u id='LP_8_1'>LP.8.1</u> has been shown experimentally to have higher binding affinity for the ACE2 human host receptor but equivalent immune escape as <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> (<https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.27.630350v1> plus see updated paper <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00015-5/fulltext> ). However the subvariant <u id='LP_8_1_1'>LP.8.1.1</u> also has the mutation S:679R which potentially further impacts transmissibility. (See also this recent study regarding ACE2 affinity: <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2825%2900113-6/fulltext>)
* <u id='LF_7'>LF.7</u> subvariants (derived from <u id='JN_1_16'>JN.1.16</u>), including <u id='LF_7_2_1'>LF.7.2.1</u> (<u id='LF_7_2'>LF.7.2</u> has S:T22N, S:S31P, S:K182R, S:R190S, S:K444R and then <u id='LF_7_2_1'>LF.7.2.1</u> has S:A475V).
* A saltation variant first reported in Canada: A <u id='BQ_1_1_1'>BQ.1.1.1</u> variant, however there is no detection of growth to date <https://github.com/sars-cov-2-variants/lineage-proposals/issues/2511>
* <u id='BA_3_2'>BA.3.2</u> - another saltation reported internationally (<https://github.com/cov-lineages/pango-designation/issues/2909>), however it does not show any ability to compete with current variants

Plus any other highly divergent variants (again, “saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see some references under List of Useful Tools below).
