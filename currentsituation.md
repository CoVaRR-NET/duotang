<u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> subvariants (with S:F456L and S:Q493E) are starting to dominate more now, with a particular interest in growth of <u id='KP_3_1'>KP.3.1</u> and <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u> variants/subvariants. However, variants with S:F456L and S:R346T (aka the “FLiRT” mutations) are still growing, such as <u id='LB_1'>LB.1</u> and <u id='KP_2_3'>KP.2.3</u>. Variants of note frequently contain the S:S31del mutation (e.g. <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> and <u id='KP_2_3'>KP.2.3</u>). Different variants are growing in different regions, depending on timing of introduction.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



* Variants with S:S31del (also referred to as S:S31-) including <u id='KP_2_3'>KP.2.3</u>, <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u>, and <u id='LB_1'>LB.1</u> subvariants, plus additional <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> variants like <u id='KP_3_2'>KP.3.2</u> and <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u>.

Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see references under List of Useful Tools below).
