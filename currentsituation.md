<u id='EG_5_1'>EG.5.1</u> subvariants, including <u id='EG_5_1_1'>EG.5.1.1</u>, are the most prevalent in many regions and likely driving the current wave of infections, supported by <u id='XBB_1_16_6'>XBB.1.16.6</u>, <u id='EG_6_1'>EG.6.1</u>, <u id='FL_1_5_1'>FL.1.5.1</u>, and a mix of some some other <u id='XBB'>XBB</u> subvariants  - all with growing immune evasive mutations. The immune evasive S:F456L mutation is in the vast majority of samples (now over 80%) and continues to steadily increase in prevalence. Multiple variant lineages have independently obtained the two mutations S:F456L and S:L455F (“FLip” mutations due to their exchange of F and L, that may confer more immune evasion) and have been growing in multiple regions, including <u id='HK_3'>HK.3</u>. Different FLip variants are predominating in different regions, and they are all still less than 10% in most regions, so they will not be having a notable impact at this time. In addition, there is another variant, <u id='HV_1'>HV.1</u> (<u id='EG_5_1_6'>EG.5.1.6</u> with S:452R), that is showing notable growth, both in Canada and globally. S:452R has been noted to confer a potential transmission advantage in past variants.



Sequences are also still being monitored closely to identify or track any highly divergent variants (variants with sudden, large mutational changes).



Variants of current interest, due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries (**Bold** only denotes changes since the last Duotang release - not necessarily those of greatest interest):



* <u id='DV_7_1'>DV.7.1</u> (<u id='CH_1_1'>CH.1.1</u> subvariant with S:F456L and S:L455F, with an interest in those with also S:452R)
* <u id='HK_3'>HK.3</u> (<u id='EG_5_1_1'>EG.5.1.1</u> with with S:F456L and S:L455F)
* **<u id='HV_1'>HV.1</u> (<u id='EG_5_1_6'>EG.5.1.6</u> with also S:452R - a mutation which may confer a transmission advantage)**

…plus any highly divergent variants (like most recently <u id='BA_2_86'>BA.2.86</u>) and sublineages with additional combinations of the mutations below.



* **S:L452R (in variant <u id='HV_1'>HV.1</u> which is growing. It potentially conferred a transmission advantage in past variants)**
* S:L455F (in particular if present with S:F456L)
* **S:475V (growing, including in lineages currently just classified as <u id='XBB_1_5'>XBB.1.5</u>, plus FL.15.1.1/FL.15, <u id='GK_3_1'>GK.3.1</u> <u id='JD_1_1'>JD.1.1</u> - though none of these individual variants show as much growth vs those listed above).**
