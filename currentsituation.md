<u id='XEC'>XEC</u> (a recombinant with the KP.3-type spike) continues to be the most prevalent. Some <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> descendants are still growing though (named MC.****, in particular <u id='MC_10_1'>MC.10.1</u> which has the mutation S:A435S). <u id='LP_8_1_1'>LP.8.1.1</u> is showing significant selective growth in multiple regions. <u id='LP_8_1'>LP.8.1</u> is a <u id='KP_1_1'>KP.1.1</u> “FLIRT” subvariant with the mutation S:493E and then S:190S, which is a predicted immune escape mutation. <u id='LP_8_1'>LP.8.1</u> has been shown experimentally to have higher binding affinity for the ACE2 human host receptor but equivalent immune escape as <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> (<https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.27.630350v1>). However the subvariant <u id='LP_8_1_1'>LP.8.1.1</u> also has the mutation S:679R which potentially further impacts transmissibility.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



* <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> which also has a KP.3-type spike, (recombinant of <u id='KS_1_1'>KS.1.1</u> and <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u>) but some changes that appear to confer a slight advantage including immune evasion, and some subvariants.
* <u id='LP_8_1_1'>LP.8.1.1</u> - <u id='LP_8_1'>LP.8.1</u> with also the mutation S:679R which potentially further impacts transmissibility (impacts the furin cleavage site). But its growth is noted to vary, dependent on the prevalence in the region of other variants.
* Additional subvariants of <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u>, like <u id='MC_10_1'>MC.10.1</u>, showing more recent growth.

Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see some references under List of Useful Tools below).



We thank the global team of those monitoring variants (such as those posting issues here: <https://github.com/cov-lineages/pango-designation/issues>), and other SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis tool providers (see List of Useful Tools below), which play a key role in identifying new variants of note.
