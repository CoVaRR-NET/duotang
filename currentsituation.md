XBB.1.5 “stricto” is decreasing now, with XBB.1.5 with S:456L and other variants with this mutation growing, plus also XBB.1.16 which has both spike and non-spike mutations proposed to be advantageous. Different variants are predominating in some different provinces depending on timing of their introduction (for example, FD.1.1 was introduced earlier in Quebec). Some XBB.1.9, and XBB.2.3 variants are still growing, however XBB.1.16 variants are outcompeting these in most regions. All of these variants have mutations that would confer additional immune evasion and/or infectivity.



Variants of current interest, due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries:

* FD.1.1 (subvariant of XBB.1.5.15 with S:F456L)
* FE.1 (subvariant of XBB.1.18.1 with S:456L)
* Multiple XBB.1.5 subvariants including those that have S:F456L
* XBB.1.16 which has S:T478R (with a particular interest in those with S:F456L)
* XBB.1.9.1, XBB.1.9.2 (which have non-spike mutations of note, with a particular interest in those with S:Q613H OR with S:F456L plus NS6:Y49H - aka orf6:y49h)
* XBB.2.3, XBB.2.3.2, XBB.2.3.3 (has mutation S:P521S, with an interest in those also with mutation 478R)

…and sublineages with additional combinations of the mutations below.



Mutations of interest include:

* S:F456L (evidence of increased immune evasion versus recent variants and a mutation growing in prevalence in multiple lineages in multiple regions)
* S:T478R (aka S:K478R - the S:T478K mutation occurred first). Evidence of increased infectivity when introduced into XBB.1.5. Associated with XBB.1.16 (which has additional mutations like S:E180V that may counteract this mutations advantage) but now seen in additional variants like XBB.2.3.
* S:P521S (evidence it could increase human ACE2 receptor binding/infectivity - associated with XBB.2.3 variants)
* S:Q613H (growing and seen in XBB.1.5, CH.1.1 and XBB.1.9.1)
* ORF1b:D1746Y (aka NSP14_D222Y - in XBB.1.16 variants)
* ORF9b:I5T (note its a synonymous mutation in the overlapping N gene)
* ORF9b:N55S (synonymous mutation in N)
