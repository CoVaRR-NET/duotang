While data on cases and genomic sampling has been limited, the data available to date are consistent with variant <u id='XFG'>XFG</u> driving a wave starting in August that has been delayed or extended in some regions.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



* subvariants of <u id='XFG'>XFG</u>, a recombinant of two Omicron lineages, <u id='LF_7'>LF.7</u> and <u id='LP_8_1_2'>LP.8.1.2</u>, showing significant growth in Canada and globally. There is no clear subsequent variant driving an increase in the provinces reporting, based on data obtained to date.

We continue to monitor for, but have not recently detected, highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations).



Note reductions or delays in data can cause delays in the detection of new variants and more uncertainty when estimating selection.
