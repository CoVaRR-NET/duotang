<u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> is still dominant and by far the most prevalent lineage. There are some other variants growing, in particular other different <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> subvariants, but nothing with a significantly better growth advantage. Collective variants with the S:S31del deletion (including <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u>) are still growing steadily and this mutation is now present in the vast majority of sampled cases. Québec has the highest estimated prevalence of <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> of the provinces providing data, with an estimate of over 90% of cases (involving all variants) containing the S:S31del. Many other regions would be expected to follow suit, given there is no clear major competitor of <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> yet apparent.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



* Variants with S:S31del (also referred to as S:S31-) including <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> in particular and <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> subvariants.
* Some recombinants such as <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> which have a KP.3-type spike, (recombinant of <u id='KS_1_1'>KS.1.1</u> and <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u>) though no significant growth advantage is observed.

Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see some references under List of Useful Tools below).
