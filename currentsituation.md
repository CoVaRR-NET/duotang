<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> (<u id='BA_2_86_1'>BA.2.86.1</u> with immune evasive mutation S:455S) has continued to grow in proportion of variants and now is the most prevalent variant in most regions. <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> subvariants are being closely tracked, including <u id='JN_1_5'>JN.1.5</u> (which has NSP13:V348T and is showing potentially notable growth internationally) and others with additional potential immune evasive mutations.



**Variants of current interest:**

(Due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries. Note this has been significantly revised from the last update, with few noted due to the current success of <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u>):



* <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> (<u id='BA_2_86_1'>BA.2.86.1</u> with immune evasive mutation S:455S - still showing notable growth in Canada).
* <u id='JN_1_5'>JN.1.5</u> (<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> plus NSP13:V348T, also known as ORF1b:V1273T, with just a few cases in Canada to date, but notable growth in some regions internationally).
* <u id='JN_1_7'>JN.1.7</u> (<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> with S:T572I and S:E1150D, or with each of these mutations singly)

â€¦plus any highly divergent variants and sublineages with additional combinations of the mutations below.



* NSP13:V348T (also known as ORF1b:V1273T - a rare two-nucleotide mutation that is TRS-related. See the excellent summary by Ryan Hisner at <https://twitter.com/LongDesertTrain/status/1745578135033110737>)
* S:683W and other furin cleavage site mutations that may impact/reduce disease severity.
* Other mutations identified through mutation scanning like S:456L etc. See:
