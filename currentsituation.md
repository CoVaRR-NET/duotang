<u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> (<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> with S:F456L and S:Q493E) and its subvariants are dominating, however multiple variants with S:F456L and S:R346T (aka the “FLiRT” mutations), are still growing in some regions such as <u id='LB_1'>LB.1</u>. Which variants are impacting a region depends on the timing of earlier acquisition of other variants. Such variants with the additional S:S31del mutation also continue to be of interest, with significant growth of the prevalence of this mutation in some regions.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



(Note re FLiRT variants below how they are described: For example, <u id='JN_1_16_1'>JN.1.16.1</u> is <u id='JN_1_16'>JN.1.16</u> plus S:R346T, but <u id='JN_1_16'>JN.1.16</u> had the other “FLiRT” mutation S:F456L, hence why <u id='JN_1_16_1'>JN.1.16.1</u> is referred to below as <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> with the FLiRT mutations, not <u id='JN_1_16'>JN.1.16</u> plus S:R346T.)



* <u id='JN_1_16_1'>JN.1.16.1</u> (<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> with “FLiRT” mutations S:F456L and S:R346T), most notably with the S:S31del deletion.
* <u id='KP_1_1'>KP.1.1</u> and <u id='KP_2'>KP.2</u> (both <u id='JN_1_11'>JN.1.11</u> with “FLiRT” mutations), most notably with the S:S31del deletion
* <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> (with S:F456L and S:Q493E) which is now the most prevalent variant in Canada overall, plus subvariants <u id='KP_3_1'>KP.3.1</u>, <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> (contains S:S31del), and KP.3.2.
* <u id='KS_1'>KS.1</u> (<u id='JN_1_13'>JN.1.13</u> with FLiRT mutations)
* <u id='KZ_1_1_1'>KZ.1.1.1</u> (and others with S:F456L, S:R356T and S:T572I - nicknamed a “FLiRTTI” variant.
* <u id='LB_1'>LB.1</u> (<u id='JN_1_9'>JN.1.9</u> with FLiRT mutations), with S:S31del.

Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning that are involved in binding or immune evasion. See:
