Variants with the S:S31del mutation are growing rapidly, involving multiple variant backgrounds including <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> subvariants (with S:F456L and S:Q493E) and multiple different variants with S:F456L and S:R346T (aka the “FLiRT” mutations). Different variants with this deletion are growing in different regions, depending on timing of introduction.



In addition saltations (highly divergent lineages) continue to be tracked, such as recent saltations of <u id='BA_1'>BA.1</u> and Delta detected (to view these, select only <u id='BA_1'>BA.1</u> or Delta under the root-to-tip plot below). These all have no evidence of growth to date and are all either noted as from a chronic infection in the additional annotation provided in the VirusSeq Data Portal or our further analysis indicates they have mutations consistent with chronic infection.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):

* Variants with S:S31del (also referred to as S:S31-) including subvariants of <u id='KP_2_3'>KP.2.3</u>, <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> (<u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u>), <u id='KP_3_2'>KP.3.2</u>, and <u id='LB_1'>LB.1</u>.

Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see references under List of Useful Tools below).

We thank the global team of those monitoring variants, and other SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis tool providers (see List of Useful Tools below), which play a key role in identifying new variants of note.
