Variant XBB.1.5 still predominates at approximately 50% of samples. Multiple other lineages are now growing that contain additional mutations noted for increased immune evasion or human ACE2 binding affinity (mutations like S:F456L, S:T478R, S:P521S and S:Q613H), with lineage XBB.1.16 and then XBB.1.9.1 and some other XBB subvariants with S:F456L currently the most successful after XBB.1.5. The number of variants growing now may appear complex, but becomes more straightforward with mutational analysis, where it becomes clearer that certain immune evasive mutations that confer a benefit to the virus are simply occurring in multiple different independent lineages. Regional differences are still noted, but more regions are starting to show similar patterns.



Variants of current interest, due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries:

* DV.1 (BA.2.75 descendant)
* EG.1 (an XBB.1.9.1 subvariant)
* EU.1 (XBB.1.5.26 subvariant, particularly those with S:P521S)
* FD.1.1 (subvariant of XBB.1.5.15 with S:F456L)
* FE.1 (subvariant of XBB.1.18.1 with S:456L)
* Multiple XBB.1.5 subvariants including those that have S:F456L
* XBB.1.16 which has S:T478R
* XBB.1.9.1, XBB.1.9.2 (which have non-spike mutations of note and in particular those with S:Q613H)
* XBB.2.3, XBB.2.3.2, XBB.2.3.3 (has mutation S:P521S, with an interest in those also with mutation 478R)

â€¦and sublineages with additional combinations of the mutations below.



Mutations of interest include:

* S:F456L (evidence of increased immune evasion versus recent variants and a mutation growing in prevalence in multiple lineages in multiple regions)
* S:T478R (aka S:K478R - the S:T478K mutation occurred first). Evidence of increased infectivity when introduced into XBB.1.5. Associated with XBB.1.16 (which has additional mutations like S:E180V that may counteract this mutations advantage) but now seen in additional variants like XBB.2.3.
* S:P521S (evidence it could increase human ACE2 receptor binding/infectivity - associated with XBB.2.3 variants)
* S:Q613H (growing and seen in XBB.1.5, CH.1.1 and XBB.1.9.1)
* ORF1b:D1746Y (aka NSP14_D222Y - in XBB.1.16 variants)
* ORF9b:I5T (note its a synonymous mutation in the overlapping N gene)
* ORF9b:N55S (synonymous mutation in N)
