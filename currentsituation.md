Data available was low over the summer, as cases were low. However, data available to date are consistent with variant <u id='XFG'>XFG</u> driving a small wave starting in August.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):

* <u id='XFG'>XFG</u>, a recombinant of <u id='LF_7'>LF.7</u> and <u id='LP_8_1_2'>LP.8.1.2</u>, plus its subvariants, showing significant growth in Canada and globally.

Plus any other highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see some references under List of Useful Tools below).



Note reductions or delays in data can cause delays in the detection of new variants and more uncertainty when estimating selection.
