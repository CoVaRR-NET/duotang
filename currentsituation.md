More variants continue to evolve that contain the immune evasive mutation S:456L, but none are growing really substantially. EG.5.1 (an XBB.1.9.2 descendent with S:F456L and other mutations of interest) is an example of a recent variant growing in some regions of Canada that have recent data, plus growing internationally. Other variants continue to be of interest including subvariants of XBB.1.16, XBB.1.9, and XBB.2.3. All of these variants have mutations that would confer additional immune evasion and/or infectivity. Any saltation variants (variants with sudden, large mutational changes) are being closely tracked.



Variants of current interest, due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries. **Bold** denotes changes since the last Duotang release):



* **EG.5.1 (XBB.1.9.2 with S:F456L plus S:Q52H plus some notable non-spike mutations)**
* FD.1.1 (subvariant of XBB.1.5.15 with S:F456L)
* FE.1 (subvariant of XBB.1.18.1 with S:456L)
* Multiple XBB.1.5 subvariants including those that have S:F456L
* XBB.1.16 which has S:T478R (with a particular interest in those with S:F456L)
* XBB.1.9.1, XBB.1.9.2, FL.5 (which have non-spike mutations of note, with a particular interest in those with S:Q613H OR with S:F456L plus NS6:Y49H - aka orf6:y49h)
* XBB.2.3, XBB.2.3.2, XBB.2.3.3 (has mutation S:P521S, with an interest in those also with mutation 478R)

â€¦plus any saltation variants and sublineages with additional combinations of the mutations below.



Mutations of interest include:



* **S:Q:52H (due to association with EG.5.1)**
* S:F456L (evidence of increased immune evasion versus recent variants and a mutation growing in prevalence in multiple lineages in multiple regions)
* S:T478R (aka S:K478R - the S:T478K mutation occurred first). Evidence of increased infectivity when introduced into XBB.1.5. Associated with XBB.1.16 (which has additional mutations like S:E180V that may counteract this mutations advantage) but now seen in additional variants like XBB.2.3.
* S:P521S (evidence it could increase human ACE2 receptor binding/infectivity - associated with XBB.2.3 variants)
* S:Q613H (growing and seen in XBB.1.5, CH.1.1 and XBB.1.9.1)
* ORF1b:D1746Y (aka NSP14_D222Y - in XBB.1.16 variants)
* ORF9b:I5T (note its a synonymous mutation in the overlapping N gene)
* ORF9b:N55S (synonymous mutation in N)
