<u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> is still dominant, and by far the most prevalent lineage. There are some other variants growing, in particular other <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> subvariants, the recombinant <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> of particular interest internationally, and other variants with the S:S31del deletion. However any growth advantage versus, <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> is still relatively small. Variants collectively with the S:S31del deletion continue to grow steadily.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



Variants with S:S31del (also referred to as S:S31-) including <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> in particular and <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> subvariants.

<u id='XEC'>XEC</u> which also has a KP.3-type spike, (recombinant of <u id='KS_1_1'>KS.1.1</u> and <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u>).



Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see some references under List of Useful Tools below).
