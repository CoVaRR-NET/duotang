<u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> is still dominant and by far the most prevalent lineage. There is still continued slower growth of other variants like <u id='KP_2_3'>KP.2.3</u> that also have the S:S31del (a deletion that is growing steadily and now present in the majority of sampled cases). Recombinants of interest globally are either not yet detected in Canada, or are still at low levels (i.e. <u id='XEC'>XEC</u>). Some other variants of interest are still at relatively low numbers, so no clear major competitor of <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> is yet apparent.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



* Variants with S:S31del (also referred to as S:S31-) including <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> in particular and its subvariants. plus <u id='KP_2_3'>KP.2.3</u>, and <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u>, and <u id='LB_1'>LB.1</u> subvariants.
* Some recombinants such as <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> (recombinant of <u id='KS_1_1'>KS.1.1</u> and <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u>).

Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see some references under List of Useful Tools below).



We thank the global team of those monitoring variants, and other SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis tool providers (see List of Useful Tools below), which play a key role in identifying new variants of note.
