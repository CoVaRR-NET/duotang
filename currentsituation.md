<u id='HV_1'>HV.1</u> (<u id='EG_5_1_6'>EG.5.1.6</u> with S:452R), is estimated to be the most prevalent variant now, and is significantly growing in most regions at a level that it would be having an impact soon.



<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> (<u id='BA_2_86_1'>BA.2.86.1</u> with immune evasive mutation S:455S) is showing potentially notable growth internationally with a slight selection advantage compared to <u id='HV_1'>HV.1</u>, but is currently at low numbers in Canada.



Multiple variant lineages have independently obtained the two mutations S:F456L and S:L455F (“FLip” mutations) that may confer more immune evasion), but are not showing as much growth at this time as <u id='HV_1'>HV.1</u>.



Sequences are also still being monitored closely to identify or track any highly divergent variants (variants with sudden, large mutational changes).



Variants of current interest, due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries (Bold only denotes changes since the last Duotang release - not necessarily those of greatest interest)::



* <u id='DV_7_1'>DV.7.1</u> (<u id='CH_1_1'>CH.1.1</u> subvariant with S:F456L and S:L455F, with an interest in those with also S:452R)
* <u id='HK_3'>HK.3</u> (<u id='EG_5_1_1'>EG.5.1.1</u> with with S:F456L and S:L455F)
* <u id='HV_1'>HV.1</u> (<u id='EG_5_1_6'>EG.5.1.6</u> with also S:452R - a mutation which may confer a transmission advantage)
* <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> (<u id='BA_2_86_1'>BA.2.86.1</u> with immune evasive mutation S:455S)

…plus any highly divergent variants and sublineages with additional combinations of the mutations below.



* S:L452R (in variant <u id='HV_1'>HV.1</u> which is growing. It potentially conferred a transmission advantage in past variants)
* S:L455F (Immune evasive mutation of particular note if present with S:F456L)
* S:L455S (Immune evasive mutation of particular note in <u id='BA_2_86_1'>BA.2.86.1</u> subvariants/<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u>)
* S:475V (including in lineages classified as <u id='XBB_1_5'>XBB.1.5</u>, plus <u id='FL_15_1_1'>FL.15.1.1</u>/<u id='FL_15'>FL.15</u>, <u id='GK_3_1'>GK.3.1</u>)
