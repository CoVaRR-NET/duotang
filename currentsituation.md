EG.5.1 subvariants, along with FL.1.5.1, are now estimated to be the most prevalent variants in many regions. However, there are other variants growing that are of note, including some some other subvariants of XBB.1.16, XBB.1.22, XBB.1.9, XBB.2.3, and XBB.1.5 with immune evasive mutations. The immune evasive S:F456L mutation is in the majority of samples and continues to increase in prevalence. The mutation S:478R is occurring with it in multiple variants showing growth (S:478R is a mutation of interest since it was found to confer increased infectivity in the XBB.1.5 variant background). Variants with the two mutations S:456L and S:455F (of interest due to their potential to provide additional immune evasion) are growing in some regions, though still in low numbers.



Sequences are also still being monitored closely to identify or track any highly divergent variants (variants with sudden, large mutational changes, such as most recently BA.2.86 identified internationally, in case it obtains additional mutations of concern).



Variants of current interest, due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries (**Bold** only denotes changes since the last Duotang release - not necessarily those of greatest interest):



* EG.5.1 (XBB.1.9.2 with S:F456L plus S:Q52H plus some notable non-spike mutations)
* EG.5.1.1 (EG.5.1 subvariant that has been growing most significantly versus other current variants).
* **EG.5.1.3 (Another EG.5.1 subvariant growing notably)**
* Multiple XBB.1.5 subvariants and others that have S:F456L and S:L455F, **including HK.3 which is an EG.5.1.1 subvariant with these mutations.**
* FL.1.5.1 (XBB.1.9.1 with S:701V, ORF1a:G993S, S:456L and S:478R, with an interest in those with S:L455F) **and other possible FL.1 subvariants with S:478R)**
* XBB.1.16 which has S:T478R (with a particular interest in those with S:F456L like XBB.1.16.6)
* XBB.1.9.1, XBB.1.9.2, FL.5 (which have non-spike mutations of note, with a particular interest in those with S:Q613H OR with S:F456L plus NS6:Y49H (aka orf6:y49h)
* XBB.2.3, XBB.2.3.2, XBB.2.3.3 (has mutation S:P521S, with an interest in those also with mutation 478R)

...plus any highly divergent variants (like most recently BA.2.86) and sublineages with additional combinations of the mutations below.



* S:Q:52H (due to association with EG.5.1)
* S:L455F (in particular if present with S:F456L)
* S:F456L (evidence of increased immune evasion versus recent variants and a mutation growing in prevalence in multiple lineages in multiple regions)
* S:T478R (aka S:K478R - the S:T478K mutation occurred first). Evidence of increased infectivity when introduced into XBB.1.5. Associated with XBB.1.16 (which has additional mutations like S:E180V that may counteract this mutations advantage) but now seen in additional variants like XBB.2.3.
* S:P521S (evidence it could increase human ACE2 receptor binding/infectivity - associated with XBB.2.3 variants)
* S:Q613H (growing and seen in XBB.1.5, CH.1.1 and XBB.1.9.1)
* ORF1b:D1746Y (aka NSP14_D222Y - in XBB.1.16 variants)
* ORF9b:I5T (note its a synonymous mutation in the overlapping N gene)
* ORF9b:N55S (synonymous mutation in N)
