Almost all variants contain mutation the mutation S:486P. The variant XBB.1.5 still predominates at over 50% of samples, but multiple other lineages are now growing significantly that contain additional mutations noted for increased immune evasion (like S:F456L) or binding to the ACE2 receptor or infectivity (like S:P521S and S:T478R). These include variants and sub variants of XBB.1.16, XBB.1.5, XBB.1.9.1 and XBB.2.3. Differences in regions are noted, with, for example, BC, Alberta and Quebec each having different mutations predominating, associated with different subvariants. Subvariants with more combinations of these mutations are being tracked.



**Variants of current interest**, due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries (note that some may not yet be detected in Canada). **Bold** denotes points added since the last update of this summary, but they do not necessarily represent the primary variants of interest - the latter are usually highlighted in the text above):

* DV.1 (BA.2.75 descendant)
* EG.1 (an XBB.1.9.1 subvariant)
* EK variants (subvariants of XBB.1.5.13)
* **EU.1 (XBB.1.5.26 subvariant, particularly those with S:P521S)**
* _FD.1.1 (subvariant of XBB.1.5.15 **with S:F456L**)_
* _FE.1 **(sub variant of XBB.1.18.1 with S:456L)**
* Multiple XBB.1.5 subvariants including those that have S:F456L
* XBB.1.16 _which has S:T478R_
* XBB.1.9.1, XBB.1.9.2 _(which have non-spike mutations of note and in particular those with S:Q613H)_
* XBB.2.3, **XBB.2.3.3** (has mutation S:P521S that could increase human ACE2 receptor binding/infectivity, _with an interest in those also with mutation 478R)_
* XBC.1.6 (a “Deltacron” variant - recombinant lineage of BA.2 and B.1.617.2)

…and sublineages with additional combinations of the mutations below.

Mutations of interest include:

* S:Y453F (could increase binding to the human ACE2 receptor)
* S:F456L (evidence of increased immune evasion versus recent variants and a mutation growing in prevalence in multiple regions)
* S:T478R (aka S:K478R - the S:T478K mutation occurred first). Evidence of increased infectivity when introduced into XBB.1.5. Associated with XBB.1.16 (which has additional mutations like S:E180V that may counteract this mutations advantage) but now seen in additional variants like XBB.2.3.
* S:P521S (evidence it could increase human ACE2 receptor binding/infectivity - associated with XBB.2.3 variants)
* S:Q613H (growing and seen in XBB.1.5, CH.1.1 and XBB.1.9.1)
* ORF1a:L3829F (aka NSP6_L260F; but previously prevalent)
* ORF1b:D1746Y (aka NSP14_D222Y)
* ORF9b:I5T (note its a synonymous mutation in the overlapping N gene)
* ORF9b:N55S (synonymous mutation in N)
