<u id='XEC'>XEC</u> continues to be the most prevalent. <u id='LP_8_1_1'>LP.8.1.1</u> is showing  selective growth in multiple regions. Variants of other potential interest include those like <u id='XEC_8'>XEC.8</u>, <u id='MC_10_1'>MC.10.1</u> (see below), plus variants like <u id='JN_1_16_3'>JN.1.16.3</u> with convergent combinations of S:456L and S:572I (the former aids immune evasion and the latter mutation is thought to increase ACE2 binding ability, but appears to benefit from the mutation S:456L occurring first). However, no variant is showing highly significant selective growth, based on the currently available data.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



* <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> which has a KP.3-type spike, (recombinant of <u id='KS_1_1'>KS.1.1</u> and <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u>) but some changes that appear to confer a slight advantage including immune evasion,  and some variants like <u id='XEC_8'>XEC.8</u> (characterized by nucleotide change T24376C)..
* <u id='LP_8_1_1'>LP.8.1.1</u> - <u id='LP_8_1'>LP.8.1</u> is a <u id='KP_1_1'>KP.1.1</u> “FLIRT” subvariant with the mutation S:493E and then S:190S, which is a predicted immune escape mutation. <u id='LP_8_1'>LP.8.1</u> has been shown experimentally to have higher binding affinity for the ACE2 human host receptor but equivalent immune escape as <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> (<https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.27.630350v1> plus see updated paper <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00015-5/fulltext> ). However the subvariant <u id='LP_8_1_1'>LP.8.1.1</u> also has the mutation S:679R which potentially further impacts transmissibility. (See also this recent study regarding ACE2 affinity: <https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2825%2900113-6/fulltext>)
* Additional subvariants of <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u>, like <u id='MC_10_1'>MC.10.1</u> (has the mutation S:A435S).
* <u id='JN_1_16_3'>JN.1.16.3</u> and others with convergent combinations of S:456L and S:572I. The former mutation aids immune evasion and the latter mutation is thought to increase ACE2 binding by positioning the Spike receptor binding domain in more of an "up" conformation (see <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07636-1>), but S:572I appears to benefit from the mutation S:456L occurring first in the lineage.

Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see some references under List of Useful Tools below).
