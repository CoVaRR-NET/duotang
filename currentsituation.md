<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> and its subvariants now predominate. Saltations (variants with a sudden large increase in number of mutations) are being closely tracked, plus <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> subvariants with additional proposed ACE2 receptor binding enhancing mutations and immune evasive mutations (such as <u id='JN_1_4'>JN.1.4</u> and <u id='JN_1_7'>JN.1.7</u> with both S:T572I and S:R346T together). However, currently there is no significant evidence that a <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> subvariant is significantly outcompeting <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u>.



Variants of current interest:

(Due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries.)



* <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> (<u id='BA_2_86_1'>BA.2.86.1</u> with immune evasive mutation S:455S - still showing notable growth in Canada).
* <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> with S:Y453F (potentially increasing ACE2 receptor binding)
* <u id='JN_1_4'>JN.1.4</u> (<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> with ORF1a:T170I, the most growing variant with a significant number of cases, other than <u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u>, with a particular interest in those with both S:T572I and S:R346T together)
* <u id='JN_1_7'>JN.1.7</u> (<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> with S:T572I and S:E1150D, or others with S:T572I like <u id='JN_1_8_1'>JN.1.8.1</u>)
* <u id='JN_1_6_1'>JN.1.6.1</u> (<u id='JN_1_6'>JN.1.6</u> with S:R346T, and other variants with immune evasive mutations like S:R346T.
