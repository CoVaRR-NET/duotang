Select subvariants of XBB.1.16, XBB.1.9, and XBB.2.3 are still currently showing the most growth, but none show substantial growth advantage. Multiple variants have now independently acquired both mutations S:456L and S:478R (mutations thought to increase immune evasion and infectivity, respectively), including FL.1.5.1 (an XBB.1.9.1 subvariant) and some XBB.1.16 subvariants. These variants, in addition to EG.5.1, are showing a growth advantage vs XBB.1.16.


Sequences are still being monitored closely to identify or track any saltation variants (variants with sudden, large mutational changes) that might arise.



Variants of current interest, due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries (**bold** denotes changes since the last report):



* EG.5.1 (XBB.1.9.2 with S:F456L plus S:Q52H plus some notable non-spike mutations)
* FD.1.1 (subvariant of XBB.1.5.15 with S:F456L)
* FE.1 (subvariant of XBB.1.18.1 with S:456L)
* -Multiple XBB.1.5 subvariants including those that have S:F456L
* **FL.1.5.1 (XBB.1.9.1 with S:701V, ORF1a:G993S, S:456L and S:478R)**
* XBB.1.16 which has S:T478R (with a particular interest in those with S:F456L **like XBB.1.16.6**)
* XBB.1.9.1, XBB.1.9.2, FL.5 (which have non-spike mutations of note, with a particular interest in those with S:Q613H OR with S:F456L plus NS6:Y49H (aka orf6:y49h)
* XBB.2.3, XBB.2.3.2, XBB.2.3.3 (has mutation S:P521S, with an interest in those also with mutation 478R)
* XBC.1.6 subvariants (XBC.1 is a “Deltacron” recombinant lineage of BA.2 and B.1.617.2 with S:L452M. XBC.1.6 contains also S:346S, S:M452R).

…plus any saltation variants and sublineages with additional combinations of the mutations below.



* S:Q:52H (due to association with EG.5.1)
* S:F456L (evidence of increased immune evasion versus recent variants and a mutation growing in prevalence in multiple lineages in multiple regions)
* S:T478R (aka S:K478R - the S:T478K mutation occurred first). Evidence of increased infectivity when introduced into XBB.1.5. Associated with XBB.1.16 (which has additional mutations like S:E180V that may counteract this mutations advantage) but now seen in additional variants like XBB.2.3.
* S:P521S (evidence it could increase human ACE2 receptor binding/infectivity - associated with XBB.2.3 variants)
* S:Q613H (growing and seen in XBB.1.5, CH.1.1 and XBB.1.9.1)
* ORF1b:D1746Y (aka NSP14_D222Y - in XBB.1.16 variants)
* ORF9b:I5T (note its a synonymous mutation in the overlapping N gene)
* ORF9b:N55S (synonymous mutation in N)
