<u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> continues to be the most prevalent lineage, with <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> (a recombinant with the KP.3-type spike) becoming more prominent now and still showing the most selective advantage. Any growth though versus <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> for any variant is still relatively small, verses what has been seen for past notable waves.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):

* <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> which also has a KP.3-type spike, (recombinant of <u id='KS_1_1'>KS.1.1</u> and <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u>) but some changes that appear to confer a slight advantage including immune evasion.
* Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see some references under List of Useful Tools below).
