<u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> is still dominant, and by far the most prevalent lineage. Variants growing include <u id='XEC'>XEC</u>, which is growing consistently in multiple provinces, though data is very limited. However any growth advantage versus <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> for any variant is still relatively small.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



* <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> which also has a KP.3-type spike, (recombinant of <u id='KS_1_1'>KS.1.1</u> and <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u>) but some changes that appear to confer a slight advantage including immune evasion.
* Additional variants with S:S31del (deletion also referred to as S:S31-) including <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> subvariants (MC.**) and <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> subvariants.

Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see some references under List of Useful Tools below).
