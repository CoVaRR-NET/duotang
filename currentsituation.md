While data on cases and genomic sampling has been limited, the data available to date are consistent with variant <u id='XFG'>XFG</u> driving a wave starting in August that was delayed or extended in some regions.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):

* <u id='PQ_17'>PQ.17</u> subvariants (<u id='PQ_17'>PQ.17</u> is a subvariant of <u id='NB_1_8_1'>NB.1.8.1</u>).
* <u id='BA_3_2_2'>BA.3.2.2</u> subvariants (including RE.2 variants).
* Subvariants of <u id='XFG'>XFG</u>, a recombinant of two Omicron lineages, <u id='LF_7'>LF.7</u> and <u id='LP_8_1_2'>LP.8.1.2</u>, showing significant growth in Canada and globally, such as <u id='XFG_5_1_4'>XFG.5.1.4</u> subvariants.

There is no clear subsequent variant driving an increase in the provinces reporting, based on data obtained to date, though based on current variant analysis a winter wave in Canada would still not be unexpected.



We continue to monitor for, but have not recently detected, highly divergent variants in Canada (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations).
