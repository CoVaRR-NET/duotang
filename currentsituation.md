<u id='XEC'>XEC</u> (a recombinant with the KP.3-type spike) continues to be the most prevalent. <u id='LP_8_1_1'>LP.8.1.1</u> is showing significant selective growth in multiple regions, while some <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> variants like those related to <u id='XEC_8'>XEC.8</u> (characterized by nucleotide change T24376C) also show growth, as well as some <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u> descendants like <u id='MC_10_1'>MC.10.1</u>.



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



* <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> which has a KP.3-type spike, (recombinant of <u id='KS_1_1'>KS.1.1</u> and <u id='KP_3_3'>KP.3.3</u>) but some changes that appear to confer a slight advantage including immune evasion, and some variants like <u id='XEC_8'>XEC.8</u> (characterized by nucleotide change T24376C).
* <u id='LP_8_1_1'>LP.8.1.1</u> - <u id='LP_8_1'>LP.8.1</u> is a <u id='KP_1_1'>KP.1.1</u> “FLIRT” subvariant with the mutation S:493E and then S:190S, which is a predicted immune escape mutation. <u id='LP_8_1'>LP.8.1</u> has been shown experimentally to have higher binding affinity for the ACE2 human host receptor but equivalent immune escape as <u id='XEC'>XEC</u> (<https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.27.630350v1>). However the subvariant <u id='LP_8_1_1'>LP.8.1.1</u> also has the mutation S:679R which potentially further impacts transmissibility.
* Additional subvariants of <u id='KP_3_1_1'>KP.3.1.1</u>, like <u id='MC_10_1'>MC.10.1</u> (has the mutation S:A435S).

Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning (see some references under List of Useful Tools below).
