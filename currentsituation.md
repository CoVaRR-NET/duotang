<u id='JN_1'>JN.1</u> is clearly now no longer the most dominant variant. Variants which contain the “FLiRT” mutations S:F456L and S:R356T, in particular <u id='KP_2'>KP.2</u> and <u id='KS_1'>KS.1</u>, have shown notable growth and more dominance in those regions where <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> was introduced later. However, <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> (which has S:456L and S:493E) has grown significantly in those regions with less <u id='KP_2'>KP.2</u> and is starting to show evidence of outcompeting the above variants. <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> is now likely the most dominant variant in Canada. There are still additional variants of note to watch out for though, such as FLiRT subvariants that also have S:T572I (named “FLiRTTI” variants. like <u id='KZ_1_1_1'>KZ.1.1.1</u>. But currently there is just one case of this variant detected to date in Canada).



Variants of current interest (due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries):



* <u id='JN_1_7'>JN.1.7</u> subvariants and other variants growing that have S:T572I (potentially increases ACE2 binding) with a particular interest with those with also S:R346T like <u id='KQ_1'>KQ.1</u> and <u id='XDK_1'>XDK.1</u> (nicknamed as having “TIRT” mutations).
* <u id='KP_2'>KP.2</u> (<u id='JN_1_11'>JN.1.11</u> with S:F456L and S:R346T and other variants with these “FLiRT” mutations including also <u id='KP_1_1'>KP.1.1</u> and <u id='KS_1'>KS.1</u>). With a particular interest in those that also have a S:S30del deletion.
* <u id='KP_3'>KP.3</u> (with S:F456L and S:Q493) which is on track to become the most prevalent variant in Canada.
* <u id='KZ_1_1_1'>KZ.1.1.1</u> (and others with S:F456L, S:R356T and S:T572I - nicknamed a “FLiRTTI” variant.

Plus any highly divergent variants (“saltation” lineages with a sudden increase in number of mutations) and sublineages with additional combinations of mutations identified through mutation scanning that are involved in binding or immune evasion. See:
