HV.1 (EG.5.1.6 with S:452R), is estimated to be most prevalent variant now, and is significantly growing in most regions at a level that it would be having an impact soon. One exception is Quebec which had its EG.5.1.1 wave earlier than others.



Multiple variant lineages have independently obtained the two mutations S:F456L and S:L455F (“FLip” mutations) that may confer more immune evasion), but at this time HV.1 is dominating overall.



Sequences are also still being monitored closely to identify or track any highly divergent variants (variants with sudden, large mutational changes).



Variants of current interest, due to their current/potential growth advantage, mutations of potential functional significance, or spread in other countries:



* DV.7.1 (CH.1.1 subvariant with S:F456L and S:L455F, with an interest in those with also S:452R)
* HK.3 (EG.5.1.1 with with S:F456L and S:L455F)
* HV.1 (EG.5.1.6 with also S:452R - a mutation which may confer a transmission advantage)

…plus any highly divergent variants (like most recently BA.2.86) and sublineages with additional combinations of the mutations below.



* S:L452R (in variant HV.1 which is growing. It potentially conferred a transmission advantage in past variants)
* S:L455F (in particular if present with S:F456L)
* S:475V (growing, including in lineages currently just classified as XBB.1.5, plus FL.15.1.1/FL.15, GK.3.1 JD.1.1 - though none of these individual variants show as much growth vs those listed above).

Plus other mutations identified through deep mutation scanning and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody escape calculator. See:
