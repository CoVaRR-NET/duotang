# Install mafft beta version used for SARS-CoV-2 alignments (as described by GISAID)

# Since the version is not stable, you will have to install mafft/7.502 in your home directory. Here is the guidelines on how to do the installation:

# 1) Download the .tar file in /home (covarrnet's home):

wget https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/test/gisaid/mafft-7.502-with-extensions-src.tgz

# 2) untar the folder:
tar -xvf mafft-7.502-with-extensions-src.tar

# 3) Make changes in the MakeFile:
cd mafft-7.502-with-extensions/core

# in the Makefile change:
# Edit the first line of Makefile
          From:
          PREFIX = /usr/local
          To:
          PREFIX = /home_covarrnet/software (where you want to install the software, if the folder doesn't exist please create one)

          Edit the third line of Makefile
          From:
          BINDIR = $(PREFIX)/bin
          To:
          BINDIR = /home_covarrnet/bin
                   (or elsewhere in your command-search path)

# 4) Install the software:

make clean
make
make install
