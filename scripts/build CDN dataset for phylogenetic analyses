#To generate a subset (and possible replicates) of the Canadian SARS-CoV-2 data from GISAID and the VirusSeq Portal

#A. generate full Canadian dataset:
#  1. pull latest GISAID mulitple sequence alignment (MSA) and subset to only have Canadian sequences (and wuhan reference)
#  2. download any Canadian sequences that are more recent (and thus not in the giant MSA) in GISAID
#  3. cross-check with VirusSeq Portal and add any sequences or metadata not in the MSA or recent extra
#  4. align sequences from 2 and 3 to the Canadian MSA
  
#B. reduce dataset by removing or reducing the number of replicates

#C. subset for phylogenetic analyses
#Aim is to get around 10-15K for making a ML tree in iqtree (standalone) and can be further downsampled to make time trees (if Nextstrain/TreeTime crashes)
#Since our intereset is in the most recent evolution of the virus we should downsample the earlier parts of the tree more 
#Replicates can be generated in parallel if needed.

#Routine 1 (higher resolution in the last 6 months, increasing until the present):
#  - keep wuhan as the root
#  - sample 2000 sequences from the start of the epidemic till 6 months ago
#  - the rest of the 8000 are the most recent with increasing number of sequences per day, 2/day 6months ago, 3/day 5months ago, ...etc, till you get a total around 10K seqs

#Routine 2 (keep all the most recent data):
#    - keep wuhan as the root
#    - keep all sequences from last month (this only makes sense if there aren't too many sequences in the last month)
#    - then keep only half of the previous month (or some reasonable amount)
#    - keep only 1K or 2K from start of epidemic till 3months ago, choose X number per week (or some other way of ensuring temporal evenness)
