# Contributing to *duotang*

*duotang* is a collaborative effort involving members of [CoVaRR-Net Pillar 6](https://covarrnet.ca/our-team/#pillar-6) (computational biology and modelling), but we welcome contributions from the SARS-CoV-2 research community as [pull requests from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
All updates, modifications and feature additions to this project are subject to review by our partners in public health.
You should also review the Canadian VirusSeq Data Portal [data usage policy](https://virusseq-dataportal.ca/acknowledgements).

Resources (metadata, trees, mutation frequency tables) can be updated with new data releases from VirusSeq using the workflow described below.

## To obtain required data

Note `<datetime>` is a placeholder for the date and time associated with downloading VirusSeq data, *e.g.*, `2022-03-16T15:17:45`.

| Command | Description | Outputs | Expected time |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| `bash download.sh` | download data release from VirusSeq, separate and re-compress | `virusseq.fasta.xz`, `virusseq.metadata.tsv.gz` | 10 minutes |
| `conda activate pangolin` | activates conda environment for Pangolin | | fast |
| `mpirun -np 2 python3 mangolin.py virusseq.<datetime>.fasta.xz` | uses MPI environment to classify sequences in parallel - note each process consumes about 10GB RAM! | `magnolin.0.csv`, `mangolin.1.csv`, etc. | 1.5 hours |
| `conda deactivate` | revert to default user environment | | fast |
| `head -n1 mangolin.0.csv > combined.csv && tail -n+2 -q mangolin.*.csv >> combined.csv` | combines `mangolin.py` outputs into a single CSV | `combined.csv` | fast |
| `python3 scripts/pango2vseq.py virusseq.<datetime>.metadata.tsv.gz combined.csv virusseq.<datetime>.csv.gz` | append Pangolin classifications to VirusSeq metadata | `virusseq.<datetime>.csv.gz` | 10 seconds |
| `python3 scripts/alignment.py virusseq.<datetime>.fasta.xz virusseq.<datetime>.csv.gz sample.fasta` | downsample genomes, use `minimap2` to align pairwise to reference and write result to FASTA | `sample.fasta` | ~2 minutes |

Repeat `alignment.py` three times to generate replicate samples: `sample[123].fasta`

## To generate phylogenies (ML and time-scaled)

The following steps should be applied to all three replicates from the preceding stage.

| Command | Description | Outputs | Expected time |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| `iqtree2 -ninit 2 -n 2 -me 0.05 -nt 8 -s data_needed/sample1.fasta -m GTR -ninit 10 -n 4` | Use COVID-version of IQ-TREE to reconstruct ML tree | File containing Newick tree string, `sample1.fasta.treefile` | ~30 minutes each |
| `Rscript scripts/root2tip.R data_needed/sample1.iqtree.nwk data_needed/sample1.rtt.nwk data_needed/sample1.dates.tsv` | Root the ML tree using root-to-tip regression, prune tips with outlying sequences (Â±3 s.d. of molecular clock prediction) and export files for TreeTime | `sample1.rtt.nwk` and `sample1.dates.tsv` | ~20 minutes |
| `treetime --tree data_needed/sample2.rtt.nwk --dates data_needed/sample2.dates.tsv --clock-filter 0 --sequence-length 29903` | Generate time-scaled tree, allowing re-estimation of the root | Folder with `_treetime` suffix, containing `timetree.nexus` file | ~20 minutes |
| `python3 scripts/nex2nwk.py data_needed/2022-04-04_treetime/timetree.nexus data_needed/sample1.timetree.nwk` | Converts NEXUS to Newick format, excluding comment fields from internal nodes | file containing Newick tree string, `sample1.timetree.nwk` | ~5 minutes |
